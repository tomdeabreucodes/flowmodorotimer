# Flowmodoro Timer

A simple timer app to help you achieve and maintain flow state.

## What is 'Flowmodoro'?

- Flowmodoro is a more flexible variant of the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), optimising for achieving and maintaining a [flow state](https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/20/flow-state-science-creativity-psychology-focus).

- Instead of leveraging focus sessions and breaks with fixed times, **you decide** when the focus session ends once you feel like you need a break. 
  
- The break time is then calculated, proportionate to the length of the focus session (In other words, the longer the focus session, the longer the break).

- Crucially, the technique also emphasises the importance of [unitasking](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-path-to-passionate-happiness/202309/do-the-one-thing-that-matters). Pick one task which will remain your focus until you can check it off. Break it down into smaller sub-tasks if needed.

## Features

1. Timer
   - Focus mode - stopwatch counting up from 0
   - Break mode - counts down to 0 from calculated break time (e.g. for 1 hour worked; 12 minutes break)
2. Todo list

That's it. No fluff.

Even the todo list feature is optional and can be hidden if preferred.

## Configuration

- Break time divisor (default: `5`)
  - This is the number used to calculate your break time
  - The formula is `focus time / break time divisor = break time` 
  - e.g. 1 hour of focus / 5 = 12 minutes break
- Timer sound effect (default: `simple chime`)
  - Select your preferred sound effect
  - This will play each time your break time expires
